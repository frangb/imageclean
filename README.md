This script will help you to remove all metadata from your images, and apply small and random variations to the image itself so it will be more difficult to identify its original source

# install dependencies
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Run the script
    python3 imageclean.py -i <originalimage> -o <image_without_metadata>
